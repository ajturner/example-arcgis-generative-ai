MPD RESPONSE: Officer cites bicyclist for riding on the sidewalk.\\n\\nWHY IT WAS WRONG: Title 18 (1201.9) permits bicycle riding on sidewalks except in the Central Business District. (Roughly Massachusetts Avenue to the north, Constitution Avenue to the south, 23rd Street NW, to the west and 2nd Street, NE to the east).\\n\\n7.

Taking the Lane INCIDENT: Bicyclist riding in the center of a narrow travel lane is stopped by police for impeding traffic.

However, according to Title 18 (1201.2) a bicyclist does not have to ride to the far right if the lane is narrow or if he/she is trying to avoid car doors, pavement hazards, or similar hazardous conditions. A narrow lane is 11 feet wide or less. Most lanes in the District are 11 feet or less.\\n\\n22\\n\\n9.

Wrong way riding is the cause of many bike crashes. (see page 6.)\\n\\nn Does a cyclist always have to ride to the\\n\\nright?\\n\\nNo, there is no law requiring cyclists to ride in the right portion of the traffic lane.\\n\\nn Who has the right-of-way in a crosswalk?\\n\\nAccording to DC code Section 1201.11, a bicyclist in a crosswalk has all the rights and responsibilities as a pedestrian in a crosswalk, though cyclists must yield right-of-way to pedestrians. According to Title 50, Section 2201.28, at unsignalized crossings, drivers must stop and yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway. At signalized crosswalks, drivers must yield the right-of-way.\\n\\nn Is it legal to ride between lanes?\\n\\nAccording to the DCMR a cyclist can split lanes. Section 1201.3(b) states:\\n\\nA person operating a bicycle may overtake and pass other vehicles on the left or right side, staying in the same lane as the overtaken vehicle, or changing to a different lane, or riding off the roadway, as necessary to pass with safety. Paragraph (c) in this section states,\\n\\nIf a lane is partially occupied by vehicles that are stopped, standing, or parked in that lane, a person operating a bicycle may ride in that or in the next adjacent lane used by vehicles proceeding in the same direction.\\n\\nn Does a cyclist have to ride in a bike lane?\\n\\nThere are no regulations in DC which state that bicyclists must use a bike lane when one is provided.\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\nTRAFFIC LAWS\\n\\nn Is it legal to ride on the sidewalk?\\n\\nWhile not recommended safe cycling practice in most instances, DC code states that cyclists are allowed to ride on the sidewalk as long as they are outside the central business district (CBD). The CBD is bounded by 2nd Street NE and SE, D Street SE and SW, 14th Street SW and NW, Constitution Ave NW, 23rd Street NW, and Massachusetts Ave NW. Within the CBD, bicycling is allowed on lands under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service including places like Lafayette Park, Farragut Square Park, the National Mall and Dupont Circle. However, if cyclists do ride on the sidewalk they must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians.\\n\\nn Do I need to register my bike?\\n\\nAs of June 1st, 2008, bikes are no longer required to be registered in the District and you cannot be pulled over for having an unregistered bike. For security reasons, WABA still recommends registering your bike with the National Bike Registry. More informa- tion can be found at www.nationalbikeregistry.com.\\n\\nn Can cars be parked in a bike lane?\\n\\nNo. Section 2405.1(g) states that it’s illegal to stop, stand or park in a bike lane. To report a car parked in a bike lane, please call 311.\\n\\nn Is it legal for cyclists to ride two abreast?\\n\\nYes. Section 1201.7:\\n\\nPersons riding upon a roadway shall not ride more than two abreast except on paths or part of roadways set aside for the exclusive use of bicycles. Persons riding two abreast shall not impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic and, on a laned roadway, shall ride within a single lane.\\n\\nn A cyclist has been “doored”.\\n\\nWho’s at fault?\\n\\nThe person in the car.

       "  Document(page_content='11\\n\\n12\\n\\nTRAFFIC LAWS\\n\\nn Are cars allowed in bus/bike lanes?\\n\\nAccording to the DCMR Section 2220,\\n\\nThe Director of the District Department of Transportation is authorized to designate any traffic lane on any roadway for the exclusive use of a single class or combination of classes of vehicles during certain hours. During the restricted hours, any vehicle may enter a restricted right curb lane solely for the purposes of taking on or discharging passengers or to make a right turn where a right turn is not otherwise prohibited by any official traffic control device.\\n\\nAccording to Section 2000.4,\\n\\nThe driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official traffic control device applicable to the vehicle which has been placed in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle, unless otherwise directed by a police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle in this chapter.\\n\\nn Is it legal to talk on a cell phone\\n\\nwhile riding?\\n\\nWhile certainly not safe, it is legal to talk on a cell phone while riding. According to Title 50, Section 1731.04,\\n\\nNo person shall use a mobile telephone or other electronic device while operating a moving motor vehicle in the District of Columbia unless the telephone or device is equipped with a hands-free accessory.\\n\\nNote that the code refers to motor vehicles, which are defined as “all vehicles propelled by internal- combustion engines, electricity, or steam.” The cell phone ban does not apply when dialing police or emergency services, nor does it apply to police or emergency personnel if acting within the scope of their official duties.\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\nCOMMON ENFORCEMENT ERRORS\\n\\n1. Dooring INCIDENT: Bicyclist struck by motorist opening door into traffic. MPD RESPONSE: Officer cites bicyclist for riding two abreast. (There was no other bicyclist involved).\\n\\nWHY IT WAS WRONG: Title 18 (2214.4) prohibits opening a car door into traffic unless it can be done safely. The officer should have cited the driver for violating 2214.4.\\n\\nTitle 18, (1201.2) calls for bicyclists to ride as far right as practicable.\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\nCOMMON ENFORCEMENT ERRORS\\n\\n2. Traffic Circle INCIDENT: Bicyclist in traffic circle is struck by car entering the circle. MPD RESPONSE: Officer tickets bicyclist for failure to yield.\\n\\nWHY IT WAS WRONG: Motorist failed to yield right-of-way to traffic already within the circle (Title 18, 2208.7).\\n\\n3. Left-turning Vehicle INCIDENT: Bicyclist riding straight (under the posted speed) is hit by oncoming vehicle turning left across her path. MPD RESPONSE: Officer cites bicyclist for failure to control speed.\\n\\nWHY IT WAS WRONG: The turning driver failed to yield the right-of- way to the cyclist who was going straight. (Title 18, 1200.3). Turning drivers must yield to vehicles approaching from the opposite direction (Title 18, 2207.4 and 2208.2).\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\nCOMMON ENFORCEMENT ERRORS\\n\\n4. Passing Too Closely INCIDENT: Bicyclist riding on the right side of the road is struck by overtaking vehicle in the same lane. MPD RESPONSE: Officer cites bicyclist.\\n\\nWHY IT WAS WRONG: Title 18 (2202.2) requires an overtaking vehicle to pass to the left at a safe distance.\\n\\n5. Right-turning Vehicle INCIDENT: Bicyclist going straight in the right lane is hit by car from same lane while the car is making a right turn. MPD RESPONSE: Officer cites bicyclist.\\n\\nWHY IT WAS WRONG: Title 18 (2203.3) requires that both the approach for a right turn and the turn itself shall be made as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway.\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n\\nCOMMON ENFORCEMENT ERRORS\\n\\n6. Sidewalk Riding INCIDENT: Bicyclist stopped for riding on the sidewalk outside of the Central Business District. MPD RESPONSE: Officer cites bicyclist for riding on the sidewalk.', metadata={'source': '<a href=\"https://ddot.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ddot/publication/attachments/DC-Bike-Law-Pocket-Guide-Oct2012.pdf\">Pocket Guide to DC Bike Laws</a>'})]}"
